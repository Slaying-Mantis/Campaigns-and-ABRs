**Dreams**
- [[Moksha]] - Trapped at the bottom of well. Trying to climb out of the well as a monkey.
- [[Hayathe]] - The entire room is covered in spiders. Tries to scream, but no sound comes out. 
- [[Aruna]] - Back at the Citadel. There is death and decay all around. A plague is spreading through the citadel, and the light of the Diamond as dimmed. 
- [[Bhumi]] - Patches of fur have fallen off. Old age is here, and the end maybe close.

**Following Nene**
- Close to the bend of the [[Holororo River]] there are tombstone sized termite mounds. There is one big mound among them, where there are giant anteaters. This mound as an usually flat top. 
- The big mound is 18 ft. tall and crawling with termites. Nene is circling around this area. 
- There is a large crack in one of the sloped slides. [[Bhumi]] steps in to the darkness of this crack.
- Thick rainforest vegetation. A towering natural structure, the mesa, is visible in the horizon, with a cascading waterfall falling off of it. There is a path leading to it. 
- We have entered the Fey realm. 
- Hayathe finds a berry that can give you Sightrot. 
- The mesa is about a thousand feet tall. The water at the pool at the base is coated in an oily grey slime. On the left, there is a small stone platform that holds a statue of an elven priest with outstretched wings. 
- [[Hayathe]] touched the water and took a bunch of necrotic damage. 
- The climb up the 1000 ft. cliff seems manageable; there a lot of handholds for this purpose. 
- As we step up to the statue, a voice rings out
> "If you would like Zulla's blessing, bathe in the pool and show that you are worthy of the blessing."
- Bhumi suggests that this statue maybe as corrupted as the pool. 
- The same voice then calls out:
> "They are not falling for it, brother."
- Combat is triggered.

- Aruna notices a ledge behind the waterfall. In this ledge is an elven skeleton and a backpack. Within in this backpack:
	- A white crystal shard worth 300 GP
	- [Dagger of Venom](https://5e.tools/items.html#dagger%20of%20venom_dmg)
	- [Potion of Invulnerability](https://5e.tools/items.html#potion%20of%20invulnerability_dmg)
- The top of plateau is covered in lush green foliage. There is another cliff over this plateau over which we see a shattered ship on the edge. 
- There is small path that leads a little cleft in the cliff. Nene knows a safe passage that avoids some suspicious green vapors.
- We climb the second cliff to go check out the wrecked ship. Seems to be an airship. 
- Hayathe sent this familiar into the lower decks and found:
	- [Dimensional Shackles](https://5e.tools/items.html#dimensional%20shackles_dmg)
- We continue on to the cleft as [[Nene]] excitedly screams Chimagua! Chimgua!
- Hayathe study the green vapors and realized these vapors are also necrotic in nature like the water. They can inflict Sightrot as well as do necrotic damage. 
- Aruna turned into an Air Elemental. We all got into her space to protect ourselves from the green vapors. With a little bit of teamwork, we just about crossed the tunnel inside the cave. 
- The tunnel opens up into a larger chamber. Glowing crystal speckle the walls like stars.
- There is a shallow pool of a brackish occupies the center and something large and scaly lays in the pool. 

# Summary
---
- We followed Nene through some mounds that led into the [[Ghost Orchid Tepui]]. 
- As Bhumi led us toward the large mesa that he saw after stepping through the mound. 
- At the base of the mesa, near the cascading waterfall, was a elven statue. A voice from the statue tried to trick us into bathe in the necrotic pool. After a swift and decisive fight, we defeated these cloakers that tried to trick. 
- We then made our way up the cliff to the wrecked ship and then eventually made our way into the cleft in the mesa from where green necrotic mist was pouring out.
