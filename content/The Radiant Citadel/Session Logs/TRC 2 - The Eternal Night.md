# Recap
---
- We pick up after the launch of the Diamond Chewer missiles. We were able to stop some of the hundreds of missiles, the rest managed to hit the Auroral Diamond. 
- The light from the diamond dimmed. When the remaining did eventually hit, it damaged the Auroral Diamond and triggered the Eternal Night - a two week period where the light of the diamond will be dimmed and its power of resurrection will be absent until the damage is healed. This probably the secondary objective to the missile launch. 

# Log

- For the next weeks the city will remain in twilight. 

**The Eternal Night Protocols**
- We have been summoned to meet the speakers at the [[Preserve]].
- People are discussing defenses. 
	- Activate the army of constructs. They lie dormant across the [[Radiant Citadel]]. 


- [[Sholeh the Elder]] is talking to [[Ara Zaratai]] (tabaxi, representative of Atagua) and [[Archmage Zamiri Thareru]]. 
- After [[Bhumi]] handed over the letter found in the derelict ship to the group. [[Archmage Zamiri Thareru]] excused herself and [[Moksha]] and [[Ojha]] began following her. 
- [[Shamiya]] and her group were researching the [[Keening Gloom]]. They suspected that the Gloom was not a storm but an [[Elder Evil]].
- [[Atagua]]:
	- Exists on a weakpoint between several planes. There are influences of the feywild and the far realms. 
	- Ataguans are obsessed with dreams and nightmares.
	- The mesa - the Ghost Orchid exists both in the feywild and Atagua.
	- Atagua is known for its cultivation of sugarcane, coffee, and cocoa. 
- The Ataguans have requested military aid against the Draught Elder. 
- The [[Army of Constructs]] is commanded by the [[Speakers]]. 
- [[Archmage Zamiri Thareru]] and [[Shamiya]] had a falling out. [[Shamiya]] was pushing for the [[Army of Constructs]] to be released for the fight against the Draught Elder. 
- Zamiri seems to be heading toward her residence. She is sobbing and walking quick. She reaches her house and has a loud quarrel with her father about [[Shamiya]].
- Left [[Whiskey]] at the house. 

**Sholeigh's Office**
- We all gather back at the [[Preserve]] and meet with Sholeigh.
	- She wants to talk to us in her office. 
	- She has a suspicion that someone from the speakers is forwarding their own agenda. 
	- The best way to deal with this would be to leave the Citadel out of this - by sending emissaries to Atagua to keep them distracted. 
	- [[Alfonz Rubinaz Zumdi]] aka the Sugarman of Atagua. The single most powerful man of Atagua. Monopoly over sugar cultivation and trade.
		- Was one of the people asking for aid. Was funding the expedition into the [[Keening Gloom]]. 
	- Tribe of Builders (Atagua) - maintain and control the roads between the mesas. 
	- Thri-kreen - primary traders of Atagua. 
	- The Green Doctors - sages who have a connection to the feywild
- Is there an internal power struggle between the speakers of the Radiant Citadel?
	- No indication of one at all. The speakers are in sync with each other, or so she thinks. 
- Rest today, and we head to the yellow quartz crystal. (The dawn incarnate of Atagua is a Capo Tree)
- El Caparazon is the capital settlement of Atagua. The people of Atagua are called the flood people. [[Alfonz Rubinaz Zumdi]] is in El Caparazon at the Sarire Sugar Mill. He lives at the Sugar Alcazar, an old hacienda.
