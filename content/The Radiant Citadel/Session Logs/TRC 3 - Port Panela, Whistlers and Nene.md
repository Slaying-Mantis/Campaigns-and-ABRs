**What Hayathe finds out:**
- Atagua shares a connection with the Ghost Orchid Tepui that exists in the Feywild.
	- Serpentine Protector - [[Chimagua]] - was fond of mortals and bestow visions
	- The flood people - first settlers of Atagua - the land was a savanah - sugarcane, coffee, cacao native crops of the land
	- Fell to foreign invaders due to the rich crops - Chimagua's vision faded away
	- [[Green Doctors]] attempted to reconnect with the Ghost Orchid - failed and allowed the Far Realm to tap into Atagua - nightmares replaced the visions & dreams of Chimagua.
	- The nightmares were connected to the Draught Elder. 
	- Green Doctors constructed a magical ward to protect the land. 
- The lands surround the Holororo River. - [[The Land of Atagua]]
- 13 year long war to drive away the colonial invaders - 200 years ago - thrived since prospering thanks to the Grass Roads - system of walkways elevated to protect against natural disasters.
- 3 Major Outposts:
	- The Devil's Hammock - builders and engineers who maintain the Grass Roads - keeps being rebuilt every six years
	- El Chapin Rum Distillery - Where the Thri-kreen inhabit
	- Silver Tapir Monastery - Green Doctors
- The Camino Rojo takes your from the Port to the Grass Roads
- Ataguans have psychic abilities. People here can communicate through dreams. 


**Port Panela**
- We reach the port. There is a feeling that we are constantly being watched. 
- [[Bhumi]] decided to steal some sugarcane for the preserve. 
- We get close to the Sarire Sugar Mill. 
	- There is shimmer, a loud crash and smoke rises from the mill.
	- Some planar interference has occurred. 
	- Inside, there is a massive sink hole inside the mill. Fire has spread to the thatched roof.
	- Two large gaunt looking creatures emerge from the sink hole. 
	- A fight ensues and the sugar mill in engulfed in flames.
- A macaw appears through silvery rift. [[Yarana]] can't get through. 
	- Chimagua is in trouble. Nene (the macaw) knows that way to the Ghost Orchid. 
- Mythical plants grow on the Tepui. The Ghost Orchid plants contain a white seed pod that helps resurrect the dead. 
- [[Alfonz Rubinaz Zumdi]] arrives at the scene and asks us to help deal with the far realm crisis. 
- The Kababa Warriors patrol the Grass Roads. 
- The baron invited us to the city to rest for the night.
