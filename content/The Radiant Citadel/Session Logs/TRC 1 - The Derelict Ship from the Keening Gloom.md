# Recap
---
Back from the quest for the special riverin water from Sagorpur. 
- Returned to the Citadel and spent time doing some shopping and crafting. 
	- [[Finklebottom's Shop of Buy Something or Get a Fireball to the Face]]
- During our rest, some shit went down with the [[Keening Gloom]]. Panic and unrest broke out. A ship is suspected to way have left the Gloom and possibly headed toward the [[Radiant Citadel|Citadel]]. 
- An evacuation order has been released. 
- The Speakers ([[Sholeh the Elder]]) suspect that this is a ship that was sent into the [[Keening Gloom]] nearly 10 years ago to study and attempt to understand.
	- [[Archmage Zamiri Thareru]] was the one who suspects this is that old ship. Her sister [[Shamiya]] had gone on this expedition.
- The speakers would like us to investigate this derelict ship when it reaches the [[Passage of Respite]].

- Hayathe: Experimental Elixir Rolls for the day.
	- Resilience: +1 AC for 10 minutes (x2)
	- Healing: 2d4+5 (Int Mod) healing + 2d6+5 (Int Mod) temp hp
- The vessel is cigar shaped. It is an Ataguan vessel. Will reach the Passage of Respite in less than hour. 
- Concorde Jewel Stats
	- AC: 18
	- HP: 300 - Damage Threshold (15)
- We board one of the Concorde jewels and intercept the ship. We reach the derelict ship about 2,000 ft. away from the Passage of Respite.
- Find Diamond Chewer Missiles right under the hatch. The missiles launch as soon as Bhumi opens the hatch. 
- Ojha goes into the derelict ship to investigate while Aruna runs back into the Concorde Jewel to warn the Citadel about the missiles. 
- It is clear at this point that even though most will be stopped by our and the Citadel's efforts. However, when the remaining do eventually hit, it will damage the Auroral Diamond and trigger the Eternal Night - a two week period where the light of the diamond will be dimmed and its power of resurrection will be absent until the damage is healed. This probably the secondary objective to the missile launch.
