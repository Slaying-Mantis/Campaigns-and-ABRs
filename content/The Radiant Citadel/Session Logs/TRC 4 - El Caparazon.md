- We reach the city of [[El Caparazon]]. The Sugarman humours us we stop at various stalls for sweets and coffee. We finally reach the estate - Sugar Alacazar.
- We arrived at the estate. Freshened and had dinner with the Sugarman. 
- We settled down for resting:
	- Mokhsa - Alone in a battlefield. Facing an army by myself, naked, with a spoon. Army obliterates me. Wake up from trance - fully rested. 
	- Hayathe - Chopping his own arm. Wake up rested. 
	- Ojha - Falls asleep. Wakes up exhausted - 1 level of exhaustion.
	- Bhumi - Goes to people's rooms, but no one is there. No Nene. Abandoned by friends. Wakes up, rested. 
- We pick up some coffee for the road. 
- We set off on the Grass Roads towards Zulla's Trail. 
- We climb down from the Grass Road and create camp under a Leomund's Tiny Hut. 
- Rest time:
	- Bhumi: Watches a mage cast Meteor Swarm on a city. Wakes up, rested. 
	- Ojha: At a funeral. Empty casket. All his friends are there pushing them into the casket. Another level of exhaustion - level 2. 
	- Hayathe: Dream of Breathless. Friends are sitting around drinking. 
	- Mokhsa: Flying over the fields. Nice pleasant dream. 
- Crossed the route to Devil's Hammock. Getting close to Zulla's Trail. 
- There is an insectile traveler. A vulture headed griffin is travelling towards the traveler. 
- We are now moving on Zulla's Trail. After a little while, [[Nene]] peels off the path and heads North. 
- A few hours into the sugarcane fields, we decide to camp. 

# Summary
---
- We went to the Sugarman's estate. Had dinner there and rested. The next morning we set off on the Grass Roads toward Zulla's Trail. 
- On the first day, nothing much happened the first day. We camped below the Grass Roads. Ojha was not able to trance and gained another level exhaustion. The next morning, Aruna cast greater restoration on Ojha to cure one level of exhaustion. 
- We set off on the next day. On Zulla's Trail, we come across an Thri-kreen traveler that was being hunted by a griffin. Ojha scared off the griffin. 
- Nene started to peel off the trail. We followed for a while then camped before reaching the destination.
