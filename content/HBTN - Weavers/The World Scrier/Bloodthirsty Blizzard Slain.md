**PHANDALIN**: Iver the Chilling Gust, an ancient white dragon, laid siege to the recently infamous town of Phandalin. Decisive action was absent on the part of the Lord's Alliance despite constant reports of dragon sightings, missing caravans, and deadly ambushes. Incidentally, the Weavers, an emerging explorer's society, took matters into their own hands and slew the ancient dragon with little causality to the town and surrounding areas. The Lord's Alliance is yet to provide an official statement on this turn of events.

Incidents of caravan ambushes and dragon sightings were already being reported to Lord's Alliance posts along the High Road, when an impossible blizzard was seen over Icespire Peak in the Sword Mountains, north of Kryptgarden Forest. A white dragon was seen prowling the area by witnesses in the days following the reports of caravan ambushes and missing cattle. The residents of Phandalin stated that snow had begun to cover the area in a matter of days and without warning. This was the first time in centuries that the Sword Mountain range had experienced weather akin to the Spine. The Council of Phandalin soon sought out the services of local mercenaries to protect travelers and merchants on the Triboar Trail, while awaiting word from the Lord's Alliance, stated Sildar Hallwinter, a retired member of the Alliance. Trade was disrupted and residents were beginning to run out of provisions due to the dragon's siege of the area.

On a serendipitous journey through the region, the Weavers, formerly the Heroes of Phandalin, stopped by the town amidst their investigations into the giant attacks across the Savage Frontier. The group had recently acquired property in the town soon after they had rediscovered the famed mines of Phandelver while under contract with the Rockseeker Brothers. Upon hearing the predicament of the people from the council, the group ventured eastward to confront the ancient dragon in its lair. After a brief game of cat and dragon, Iver was soon seen flying toward the town of Phandalin, where the Weavers had already regrouped to lay ambush. The group managed to draw the dragon's wrath away from the town and lock it in battle at a safe distance. After what eyewitnesses described as a terrifying encounter, the group slew the ancient white dragon, while suffering casualties of their own. However, with swift action from the group’s druid, all members survived the tryst with Iver the Chilling Gust.

The unnatural blizzard caused by the presence of the dragon is expected to clear entirely in a few days’ time. Trade and travel in the area are also expected to resume thanks to the Weavers donating the loot from the dragon's hoard towards funds to improve the safety of Phandalin and its surrounding areas. An act of kindness that is sure to turn some jaded heads.
