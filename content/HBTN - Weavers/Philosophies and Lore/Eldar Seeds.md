# Notes from Candlekeep

Eldar seeds are the offspring of the first trees that were gifted sentience by the children of [[Corellon]]. These trees come from the [[Summer Queen]]'s lands. They are the most sacred gift that can ever be given to a visitor at the [[Seelie Court]].

These trees bring nourishment and fertility to the lands around them. They grow and adapt like any sentient creature. They can also succumb to intense emotion and circumstance, although, it takes hundreds of years for such a change to manifest. 

These trees can survive for millennia and live to see the transition of ages. They slowly and steadily release their lifeforce into their surroundings until they eventually become normal trees. 

According to legend, they were molded to mimic the engine of the cosmos - stars.
