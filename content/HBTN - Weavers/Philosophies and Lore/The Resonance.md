The [[Astral Plane]] is a realm of thought, emotion, imagination, and supposedly the soul. It comprises all good feelings and thoughts, and all the bad ones as well. It technically represents all that is, was, will be, and could've have been. Interesting stuff.

The Natural World believers propose that stars were the source of the Astral Plane, since they provide the heat necessary for life itself. Others believe that is an unknowable realm existing between the gaps of our very world, constantly being shaped by the very eye of the perceiver.  

**Resonance**

The Resonance, it seems, is an unpredictable event. There is no accurate method of measuring its incidence since it is impossible to predict the thousands of factors that contribute to the build-up of negative energy. And what is this negative energy? It is literally every feeling and thought we wish we never had. It seems to only be noticed when it is about to burst, much like a volcanic eruption or a storm. You can see and interpret the signs, but you can never accurately predict when it will hit. 

The Astral Plane is only the point of origin for a resonance. As it swells and dissipates its energy, it ripples through all known and unknown realms, re-ordering and re-structuring the key fundamental rules that make up that plane. Its supposedly chaotic and the outcome unknowable. Not very different from the kind of outbursts that Master Errich has from time to time. Interestingly, sorcerers of that nature carry some measure of similar qualities, although much fainter.    

There are very few entities that have observed more than one resonance. Most of us will probably see one in our lifetime if we are very very lucky, or unlucky, depending on how you feel about it.Â  The last known resonance or something close to it was more than 20,000 thousand years ago. Around the time of the [[Sundering]], when Abeir was discovered and its lands brought here.
