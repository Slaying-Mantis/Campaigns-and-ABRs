# Notes from Candlekeep

They are the only tangible evidence of the [[Negative Energy Plane]]. They seem to be the only known extension of that plane. In fact, if it weren't for the existence of Nightwalkers, there would be no knowledge of the existence of the [[Negative Energy Plane]]. 

Nightwalkers are extremely rare occurrences. Those that attempted to study them had to travel across realms and planes to spot even two of them in their lifetimes. 

Almost all Nightwalker sightings are at places where people have mysteriously gone missing. There is never any trace left behind of these people that go missing. Researchers have reported seeing trapped creatures at the core of a nightwalker when attempting to see ethereal influences on these creatures. Some claimed to have seen the likeness of the very people that were reported missing. Although, there is no concrete evidence for the same. 

The existing evidence and hypothesis points to the possibility that Nightwalkers may be the result of sentience and material information from a foreign body being introduced to this unknown plane. Possibly a natural process of balancing the exchange of energy and maintaing the [[Law of Conservation]].
