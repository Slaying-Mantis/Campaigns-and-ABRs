# Notes from Candlekeep
---
They have existed since the beginning of recorded history. No one has yet been able to understand them. 
Many that have attempted to deconstruct and interact with them at a deep level, eventually disappeared. Either presumed dead or just missing. Some were able to use them as a medium to direct magical energy, like the Netherese kingdoms.  

It seems that when a new material is introduced to an obelisk, it can begin to understand and interact with that material. It is almost as if the obelisks are sentient, yet without the obvious markers of sentience. 

They have been sighted in many parts of the world. They have been know to disappear in previously seen locations and appear in new locations. It is unclear if they are actually moving from one place to another or simply blinking in and out of existence. Since no one obelisk has any unique identifiers, researcher have been hard-pressed to provide evidence for the former hypothesis.
